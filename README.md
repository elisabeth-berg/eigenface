### What is PCA?
Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method that transforms an n-dimensional data set (via orthogonal matrix multiplication) into its "closest" k-dimensional approximation. 

### What is an Eigenface?
Within the context of image classification (here, specifically face recognition), the data is a set of images. Any appropriate machine learning model can be trained on this dataset, then used to classify a previously unseen image. Suppose X is an image feature matrix of dimensions (p x n). The p rows of X are the pixels of the image (possibly flattened from a pixel matrix), and each of the n columns is a single image. The values of the matrix measure the black/white intensity of a single pixel.
